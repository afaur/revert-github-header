#Revert Github Header
Very simply overrides css styles to revert the github header back.  I do like the
dark header but would rather have a day/night mode which would change the site
theme completely.

#How is this different then other solutions
This solution avoids any update flashes since js is not involved in the solution.

#Manual install
- git clone this repo
- open `chrome://extensions/` in your browser and click “Developer mode” (top right)
- click `Load unpacked extension` then select the folder where you cloned this repo
